# Netflix Clone

This project is a simple Netflix homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It is a non-functional, static webpage that imitates the design of the popular streaming service, Netflix.

## Features

- **Hero Section**: A large hero section with a call-to-action button for starting a membership.
- **Feature Highlights**: Several sections that highlight the core features of Netflix, including downloadable content, multiple screens, and no ads.
- **FAQ Section**: An interactive FAQ section with collapsible panels for common questions.
- **Footer Section**: A footer with important links, including terms of service, privacy policy, and more.

## Future Enhancements

To further improve the Netflix clone, I plan to add the following features based on the real Netflix website:

1. **Mobile Navigation (Hamburger Menu)**: Implement a hamburger menu for smaller screens to make navigation easier on mobile devices.
2. **Video Preview in Hero Section**: Replace the static hero image with a background video or video preview for a more engaging experience.
3. **Hover Effects on Feature Cards**: Add smooth hover transitions on the feature sections that reveal additional information.
4. **Accordion Animation in FAQ Section**: Implement smooth animations when opening and closing FAQ panels to match Netflix's user experience.
5. **Sticky Navbar**: Keep the navigation bar visible as the user scrolls through the page.
6. **Footer with Language Selection**: Add a language dropdown in the footer to allow users to choose their preferred language.
7. **Social Media Links in Footer**: Add social media icons with links to Netflix's accounts, simulating real-world usage.
8. **Smooth Scrolling for In-Page Links**: Implement smooth scroll behavior when navigating between sections, providing a more polished user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout, including responsive design techniques with media queries.

This project is a work in progress, and I aim to continuously improve it by adding new features that bring it closer to the real Netflix user experience.
